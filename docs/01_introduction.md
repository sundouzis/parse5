<i>WHATWG HTML5 specification-compliant, fast and ready for production HTML parsing/serialization toolset for Node.</i>
</p>
parse5 contains nearly everything what you will need to deal with the HTML. It's the fastest spec-compliant HTML parser
for Node to the date and will parse HTML the way the latest version of your browser does. It's stable and used
by such projects as [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), [Angular2](https://github.com/angular/angular),
[Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) and many more.
